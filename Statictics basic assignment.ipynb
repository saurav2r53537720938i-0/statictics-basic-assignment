    "Statictics is a branch of mathematics that involve collecting,organizing,analyzing,interpreting,and presenting data.It provide methods and techniques for making inferences and decision in the face of uncertainity often using probality theory. Statictics is widely used in various fields such as science,business econmics,social science,and more,to understand patterns,trends,and relationship within data."
